Homework 1, knights and knaves.


Gabby says: Lewis and I are both knights.
Lewis says: Ellie would say I am a knight.
Ellie says: Either I am a knight or Lewis is a knight, but not both of us.

//type your solution (knight or knave) next to each question
What type is Gabby? knave
What type is Lewis? knave
What type is Ellie? knight


Why can't they all be knaves?

Suppose they are all knaves.
    Gabby's statement works - it is false that they are both knights.
    Lewis's statement doesn't work - he knows that Ellie would
        lie and say he is a knight, and he is lying about what she
        would say
    Ellie's statement works - neither Lewis nor Ellie are knights,
        so it is a lie that exactly one is a knight.

////////////////////////////

Today:
- begin propositional logic
- equivalent statements
- satisfiability

////////////////////////////////////////

Propositional logic.


- a set of *propositional atoms* (statements that can be T/F)
    --> these will be our boolean variables in logic statements
    --> minimal (don't contain any logical operators)

p: I am tired

!p

- connected by logical operators



- join together to make new *propositions* (logical sentences)
    that can be true or false



////////////////////////////////////////

Which ones are propositions? Propositional atoms?

Today is Thursday.
    is a proposition
    also a propositional atom


What time is it?
    not a proposition (or a propositional atom)


x == 2
    is a proposition
    also a propositional atom


x != 2
    is a proposition
    not a propositional atom (contains a NOT)


Pigs can fly.
    is a proposition
    also a propositional atom


z != 7 && str.contains(sub)
    is a proposition
    not a propositional atom (contains NOT and AND)

Drive carefully.
    not a proposition (or a propositional atom)

y <= 4
    is a proposition
    also a propositional atom


I am hungry and thirsty.
    is a proposition
    not propositional atom (contains AND)


////////////////////////////////////////

Suppose we have these propositional atoms:

    p: It is below freezing.
    q: It is snowing.
    r: y <= 4
    s: x == 2

How would we express these as English sentences?

    ¬p:
        It is not below freezing

    p ∧ q:
        It is below freezing and it is snowing.

    p → q :
        If it is below freezing, then it is snowing.

    ¬p → ¬q:
        If it is not below freezing, then it is not snowing.


    r ∨ s:
        y <= 4 || x == 2

    ¬r:
       !(y <= 4)
       y > 4

////////////////////////

Example:

You can't enroll for the course if you haven't taken the prerequisite.


--> what are the propositional atoms?

    p: You can enroll in the course
    q: You have taken the prerequisite

--> translate to propositional logic:

    ¬q → ¬p


--> more translations:

if you can enroll, you have taken the prereq

    p → q



They are equivalent because for every truth
assignment, they have the same output.

(equiv1.logika and equiv2.logika)


/////////////

Example:

if (x <= 2 || y >= 0) {
    if (z != 17) {
        answer = 25;
    }
}

How could we write what our if-statement is doing?

If I meet all my conditions, then answer is 25

Propositional atoms/translation?

p: x <= 2
q: y >= 0
r: z == 17
s: answer == 25

(p V q) ^ !r -> s




--> what must be true if answer is NOT 25?

!s -> (I didn't meet one of my conditions)

!s -> !((p V q) ^ !r)

!s -> (!(p V q) V r)


!s -> ((!p ^ !q) V r)

//////////////////////////////////

Consider these two statements:

p: I am at least 16 years old
q: I can drive a car


1) If I am at least 16 years old, then I can drive a car.

    (only false when I am at least 16 but I can't drive)
    p -> q

2) I'm not at least 16 years old or I can drive a car.

    (only false when I am at least 16 and I can't drive)

    !p V q

--> how could we translate them to propositional logic statements?




--> are they saying the same thing?




--> could we PROVE it?

with two truth tables - could show that for all
    truth assignments, both statements have the same output







//////////////////////////////////

DeMorgan's Laws.

...DeMorgan has so many laws...
    these are a couple of them.




if (a == 4 || a == 5) {
    statements
}

How could we express the NEGATION
(i.e., what condition would be true for the "else")?

if (a != 4 && a != 5)





///

if (a == 4 && b == 5) {
    statements
}

How could we express the NEGATION
(i.e., what condition would be true for the "else")?

if (a != 4 || b != 5)



//////////////////////////////

DeMorgan's laws in propositional logic:

¬(p ∨ q) is equivalent to...¬p ∧ ¬q

¬(p ∧ q) is equivalent to...¬p ∨ ¬q


--> how can we prove the first of DeMorgan's laws?

(demorgan1.logika and demorgan2.logika)



////////////////////////

Another if-statement example.

'a'

if (Character.isDigit(letter) || num < 10) {
    statements
}

--> how would we negate it without using a ! operator?

if (Character.isDigit(letter) == false && num >= 10)




///////////////////////

And one more. Negate this one:

if ((y >= 4 && num != 14) || x > 0) {
    statements
}

negate it:

if (!(y >= 4 && num != 14) && x <= 0)

if ((y < 4 || num == 14) && x <= 0)


///////////////////////

Other equivalences (≡ means "is equivalent to").
(If we wanted, how could we prove them?)


¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q              (DeMorgan's laws)
¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q


p ∧ T ≡ p                       (identity laws)
p ∨ F ≡ p


p ∨ p ≡ p                       (idempotent laws)
p ∧ p ≡ p

¬(¬p) ≡ p                       (double negation law)


p ∨ q ≡ q ∨ p                   (commutative laws)
p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p

p ->q vs q -> p????? NO!
    p = F
    q = T

    so they are NOT equivalent
    (to show statements aren't equivalent,
    just need one truth assignment where they
    outputs differ)

(p ∨ q) ∨ r ≡ p ∨ (q ∨ r)       (associative laws)
(p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r)


p ∨ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)     (distributive laws)
p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)



p → q ≡ ¬q → ¬p                     (contrapositive)
p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q                      (can turn implies into an or)



--> you may still be asked to demonstrate these with
    truth tables or prove them with natural deduction (coming soon)

//////////////////////////

What is equivalent to:

¬p → q

p -> q is equivalent to !p V q


p V q

//////////////////////////

are these equivalent? NO!

    (p → q) → r
    p → (q → r)

to show they are NOT equivalent, just need ONE
truth assignment where the output differs

    p = F
    q = T
    r = F

For the above truth assignment, the first statement
    is false:
        (F -> T) -> F
        T ->F
        F

    but the second is true:
        F -> (T -> F)
        F -> F
        T


In general, how to show statements are NOT equivalent?

just need one truth assignment

/////////////////////////

(stopped here)

/////////////////////////

Satisfiability.

- definition: a statement is satisfiable if there is at least
one truth assignment that makes the statement true


- what kind of statement is satisfiable? what kind is not?

satisfiable: contingent, tautology
not satisfiable: contradictory


- is this satisfiable?

        (p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (q ∨ ¬r) ∧ (r ∨ ¬p)








SAT

can we check a solution to a problem in polynomial time?
