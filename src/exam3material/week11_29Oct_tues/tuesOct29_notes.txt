HW 8 due tonight

Recursive definitions.

Consider function f(n) = 10n + 3 over natural numbers
Rewrite with a recursive definition:




Give a recursive definition of the function multBy2(n), where
multBy2(n) is the product of 2 and the nonnegative integer n.




Give recursive definition of set of odd positive integers.



/////////

Use proof by contradiction to prove that the sum of a rational and
irrational number is irrational.

How to write as an IF/THEN?


Rational: ?


How to start the proof?



//////////////////

HW 9 will be posted after class, due next Tues

//////////////////

Today:
- begin programming logic

//////////////////

Apply proof techniques and similar reasoning to prove correctness
of basic programs.

(Why does this matter?)






////////////////////////////

Programs are written in Slang, which is a subset of Scala. We will
study:
    - variables (boolean, int, sequences)
    - printing and user input
    - math operations
    - conditional operations
    - if and if/else statements
    - while loops
    - functions


--> Logika/Slang were created by the Santos lab in the CS dept.
    --> has funding from DARPA, Air Force for model checking


--> Can run on the JVM
--> Slang can also be compiled to C
--> can demonstrate program correctness down to machine code
--> more info: https://slang.sireum.org/about/


Basic program #1
    - get user input number, add one to it, print it out

Basic program #2
    - get user input number, print whether it is positive or negative

Basic program #3
    - use a loop to print the numbers from 10 down to 1

Basic program #4
    - write a separate function to add all elements in a sequence
    - create a sequence, call the function, print the result


--> see how to run programs



First: prove program correctness in "manual" mode
    (we have to process the knowledge gained
    in each statement)


Then: prove program correctness in "auto" mode
    - we provide function contracts and loop invariants
    - checker can make sure our program meets our
    specifications


////////////////////////

Preconditions: things we must assume about user input
    or parameters to a function


Postconditions: what we are claiming is true at some point in
    our code (this is what we want to PROVE)


/////

assume statements
    - lets us make assumptions about user input
    - we can pull these assumptions into a proof

    (declaring preconditions about the input)

/////

assert statements
    - what we want to prove is true after some code
        (postconditions)
    - must prove EXACTLY that statement before we assert it



How are Logika asserts different from C# (and other languages)?





////////////////////////

Process of validating a program:



(any assumptions needed about user input - assume)

program statement

(claims/asserts)

program statement

(claims/asserts)

program statement

(claims/asserts about output/results/postconditions)






///////////////////////////////

Claims go in "proof blocks", which look like:

Deduce(
    //line numbers with claims and justifications
    //similar to prop/pred logic proofs

    x ( claim ) by Justification(params)
)

//////////////////////////////

Justifications (for now):

Premise
    - something from an assume
    - a program assignment that was just executed
        (use == to show equality in the claim)
    - something shown in a previous proof block


////

Algebra*
    1 ( x == 2 ) by Justification,
    2 ( x >= 2 ) by Algebra*(1)
    3 ( 4 > 0 ) by Algebra*()


    - any algebraic manipulation on a previous claim
    - include all relevant line numbers in whatever order
        (might be zero or 3+)

////

ANY of your propositional/predicate logic justifications
    (especially AndE1, AndE2, AndI, OrI1, OrI2)




//////////////////////////////

(add.sc)
Example: write a program that creates a number, x, with value 2

Create a value, y, that is initialized to x + 2

We want to assert at the end that y is 4





//////////////////////////////

Example (max.sc):

get 2 user inputs: x and y
assume that x > y
set a max variable to x

want to assert that max is the biggest of our two inputs



//////////////////////////////

The Algebra* justification works for most mathematical manipulations

Will not work on claims involving ∧, ∨, →, ∀, ∃

Another justification: Subst









/////////////////////////////

Subst_<(m, n)



Deduce(
    ...
    m ( LHS_M == RHS_M ),      //must be an equivalence
    ...
    n ( claim1 ),
    ...
    j ( claim2 )              by Subst_<(m, n)
)

claim2 rewrites claim1 by substituting all occurrences of
    LHS_M with RHS_M


Think of Subst_< as LHS <- RHS

    (the RHS is coming in for each LHS)


Example:

Deduce(
    ...
    m ( x + 1 == y - 4 ),
    ...
    n ( x*(x + 1) == (x + 1) + y ),
    ...
    j ( ??? )     by Subst_<(m, n)
)





/////////////////////////////

Subst_>(,m n)

Deduce(
    ...
    m ( LHS_M == RHS_M ),      //must be an equivalence
    ...
    n ( claim1 ),
    ...
    j ( claim2 )             by Subst_>(m, n)
)

claim2 rewrites claim1 by substituting all occurrences of
    RHS_M with LHS_M


Think of Subst_> as LHS -> RHS

    (the LHS is coming in for each RHS)


Example:

Deduce(
    ...
    m ( x + 1 == y )
    ...
    n ( y*(x + 1) == (x + 1) + y )
    ...
    j ( ??? ) by Subst_>(m, n)
)





/////////////////////////////////

Example (code fragment):

val num: Z = x + 2
val answer: Z = 4*num + 8
val another: Z = 5 - (x + 2)*3


Deduce(
    1 ( num == x + 2 )              by Premise,
    2 ( answer == 4*num + 8 )       by Premise,
    3 ( another == 5 - (x+2)*3 )    by Premise,

    //substitute in for "num" in "answer"

    //substitute in for "x+2" in "another"
)


//////////////////////////////

Assignment with mutation


var x: Z = 2

//what could we put in a proof block here?



x = x + 2       //what do we know about x?


//what might we try to put in a proof block here?
//would it make sense?



x = x + 4




//////////////////////////////

If you change the value of variable "name", write that claim
using:

    Old(name)

in the very next proof block. Only ONE "Old" value exists
at a time.


The Old(name) refers to value of the variable just before
the latest update.

Goal: state that variable's current value WITHOUT using Old
by the end of next proof block


y = y + 4

Deduce(
    ???
)

x = x + 3

Deduce(
    ???
    //what "Old" values are available?
)

//////////////////////

Example (add3.logika):

- get an input number
- save out an "orig" value that is equal to the input

add 1 to the input number
add 2 to the input number

want to assert that the resulting number is 3 more than the orig value



--> what if we added an assume that the input number
    was positive?

--> could we add to our assert that the resulting number
    is positive?

//////////////////////

Example (swap.sc):


inputs x and y (save their original values)

//Example: x = 4, y = 7

x = x + y         //x = ?, y = ?
y = x - y         //x = ?, y = ?
x = x - y         //x = ?, y = ?
